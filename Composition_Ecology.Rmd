# Abstract

Forest inventory data are essential for understanding tree species distributions along environmental gradients, and for projecting forest responses to climate change.  However, the stability and representativeness of contemporary tree-climate distributions is poorly understood.  Here we show that historic land use and climate change over the last two centuries have significantly altered tree-climate relationships, using contemporary and historical data for climates and 15 common tree genera in the northern US. Realized niches have shifted towards cooler maximum temperatures, higher minimum temperatures, and higher rainfall. A new attribution method indicates that both historic climate change and land use produced these shifts, with the relative importance varying among genera and climate variables.  The most common climate/land-use interaction is compounding, in which historic land-use exacerbates climatic shifts toward warmer or wetter distributions. Compounding interactions are critical because they suggest that contemporary-based models of species distributions may underestimate species resilience to climate change.

# Introduction

*The introduction should summarize briefly the background and aims, and end with a very brief statement of what has been achieved by the work.*

Global change ecologists and biogeographers use contemporary distributions of species, and, increasingly, paleohistorical datasets to map distributions of species and species traits within environmental space REFS. These distributions of species within climate space, combined with future climate scenarios and species distribution models, can be used to assess species exposure and sensitivity to climate change, identify species and habitats of concern, set conservation priorities, and prepare for shifts in habitat suitability caused by climate change  [@pellatt2012using;@iverson2013tree;@iverson1998predicting;@anderson2013nichemodels;@guisan2013predicting]. Forest inventory datasets, such as the US Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA), are particularly rich observational datasets that have, *e.g.* been used to assess early signals of range shifts via the distributions of mature trees and seedlings [@monleon2015evidence;zhu2012failure] and to parameterize models of current and future tree distributions [@iverson2008estimating;@iverson1998predicting].

Increasingly, ecological models and their predictive capacity are being improved by integrating contemporary observational data with paleohistorical data, when available [@moritz2013future;@maguire2015modeling].  Future projections that rely only on contemporary observational data are limited by a narrow time window that may obscure greater plasticity in species-climate responses [@maiorano2013building], incompletely delimit species fundamental niches that lie outside the current realized environmental space [@jackson2000responses], miss the responses of species to past no-analog climates [@veloz2012no], and fail to detect the effects of historical legacies and contingency on species distributions [@svenning2015influence]. Paleoecological records from the last deglaciation show that the time lag of forest responses to abrupt climate change varies from a few years to centuries [@williamsinpress;@webb1986vegetation;@ordonez2013realized;@svenning2015influence]. Habitat loss through human agency can impact apparent species distributions at timescales of thousands [@sarmento2013impacts] to hundreds of thousands of years [@ivory2016niche]. In principle, dynamic vegetation models [*e.g.*, @leiblein2016modelling] can represent the physiological, demographic, and dispersal processes that cause tree populations to lage climate change.  In practice, however, parameterization of these models is critical, and processes operating at large temporal and spatial scales remain poorly constrained [@moorcroft2006close].

Over the last several centuries, climate change and land use have both substantially affected species distributions and vegetation structure [@gehrig2007tree] REFS. Understanding the interacting effects of land-use change and climatic change on species-climate relationships is of particular importance, because anthropogenic land use is highly structured and differentially occupies particular habitat types and portions of climate space.  Hence, species distributions and protected natural areas often represent a biased selection from the available environmental space [@scott2001nature].  This biasing can confound studies that use contemporary distributional data to predict species responses to future climate scenarios [@pyke2004habitat].  

The interactions between climate and land-use change can be classified into three types: (1) compounding, (2) confounding and (3) counteracting [modified from @pyke2004habitat]. Compounding effects occur when climatic and land-use change cause species distributions to shift in the same direction.  For example, for butterfly species in the northern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, warming has been compounded by land-use conversion at the lowest elevations, both driving species upslope [@forister2010compounded]. Confounding effects may cause little overall change on species distributions, with land-use pressure falling within the central distribution for the environmental gradient.  The overall spatial and climatic distribution of Garry oak (*Quercus garryana*) in the Pacific Northwest has changed little over the past several centuries, but land-use conversion has excluded it from the deep-soil sites it formerly occupied [@macdougall2004defining;@pellatt2014environmental].  Hence, predictive models for Garry oak [@pellatt2012using] using only contemporary data may be confounded by this range-wide interaction between human land use and soil characteristics. Counteracting effects occur when climate and land use change act in opposite directions, narrowing the available geographic and climatic space available for species. For example, bird species in the Sierra Nevadas should show downslope migration in response to shifts in precipitation [@tingley2012push], but this downslope migration is limited by land-use conversion in the lowlands.

PDSI shows strong coherence with P~ann~ in this region. (f) Patterns of land-use change in the upper Midwestern United States. Land use data from the NLCD [@jin2013comprehensive].*")`

In the upper Midwestern US, tree distributions and community composition over the last several centuries have been heavily influenced both by the land uses associated with EuroAmerican Settlement in the 1800s [@goring2015preset;@schulte2007homogenization;hanberry2012comparison;@rhemtulla2009historical] and by the climate changes accompanying the end of the Little Ice Age [@hotchkiss2007response;@paquette2013climatic] and current anthropogenic warming [@wicci2011climate].  Modern forests, as represented by the Forest and Inventory Analysis [@woudenberg2010forest], show greater homogeneity, weaker ecotones, and significantly different species associations than forests surveyed as part of the Public Land Survey System, a survey that covered the western United States prior to widespread land-use conversion in the late 1800s [@goring2015preset;@schulte2007homogenization]. There has been widespread conversion of wildland ecosystems to agricultural and urban land use [@rhemtulla2009historical], particularly along the historical prairie and savanna margins of the region (`r fig_nums("land_use_clim", display = "cite")`f).  Forested regions in the northern Great Lakes States have been also affected by widespread timbering during the late 19th and early 20th-century and ongoing land management REF.  In northern forested regions, we may expect to see expanded ranges of early successional species and reduced abundances of late-successional species, following widespread logging.  Additionally, some tree species, *Ulmus americana* and *Castanea dentata* have experienced rangewide population collapses caused by the introduction of exotic pathogens REFS. These land use changes are superimposed on strong regional gradients of temperature and precipitation in the upper Midwest and two major ecotones, one from prairie/savanna to closed forest, in an approximately west to east direction, and one from conifer dominated, sub-boreal forests to deciduous forest in a north to south direction.  

Here we show that the climatic distributions of tree genera in the upper Midwest have significantly shifted over the last 100 years as a result of historic climate change, land use, and pathogen outbreaks, and assess the relative impacts of regional climate shifts and vegetation change in driving these changes.  To this end, we use gridded historic and contemporary climate observations (PRISM) and estimates of pre-settlement and modern forest vegetation [@goring2015preset] to map the geographic and climatic distributions for 15 major tree taxa in the upper Midwestern United States.  We construct four observed and hypothetical sets of tree-climate relationships, using a 2x2 factorial of pre-settlement and modern vegetation and climates and develop a new method, based on Hellinger distances among tree distributions, to quantify the total change and relative importance of historic vegetation and climate change. We assess whether climate and vegetation changes are compounding, counteracting or confounding based on the magnitude and direction of species-climate shifts. We use this framework to discuss the potential impacts of land-use conversion on species resilience to climate change as predicted by species-distribution models generated from modern distributional data.

Settlement-era forest data are based on survey data from the Public Land Survey System [PLSS: @white1983history;@schulte2001original;@goring2015preset], aggregated to a 64 km^2 grid across the upper Midwestern United States [@goring2015preset]. We briefly review the methods here. PLSS data originally were collected on a 1 x 1 mi grid across the Upper Midwest from 1830 - 1904 [@schulte2001original;@almendinger1996minnesota;@white1983history]. At each survey, point surveyors noted the closest two to four trees and recorded their common name, distances to the survey point, diameters at breast height and azimuth to the tree. Goring et al. [-@goring2015preset] aggregated this data to an 8x8 km grid, resulting in a gridded data product with an average of 61 survey points per cell, or approximately 120 trees per cell. This process included data cleaning, taxonomic standardization, and the application of spatially varying correction factors [@goring2015preset]. Using the count data produced by Goring et al. [-@goring2015preset], we produce presence-absence distributions for each taxon, across the upper Midwest for 15 common tree genera (Table `r tab_nums("genera_table", display = "cite")`). Common names for certain taxa, such as "Ironwood" can not be clearly resolved to a single tree genera, as such we combine *Ostrya* and *Carpinus* (ironwood), and *Thuja* and *Juniperus* (cedar). Here presence is defined as at least one recorded tree in any 8x8 km grid cell.

Modern forest data are from the US Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, which began in the 1930s and provide detailed inventories of contemporary tree distributions [@iverson2013tree;@zhu2012failure]. FIA datasets are publicly available surveys of forest composition (for all regions with > 10% forest cover) [@woudenberg2010forest].  FIA uses a nationally standardized sampling procedure, for all land with greater than 10% forest cover.  Each Phase 2/3 FIA plot  consists of four, 7.32m radius, circular sub-plots which are sampled intensively [@woudenberg2010forest].

Comparisons between historical and modern vegetation must address differences in sampling design between the PLSS and FIA datasets [@goring2015preset;@kronenfeld2014validating;@kronenfeld2010influence]. Here the primary tool for maximizing comparability is via aggregation, both by spatially aggregating records from both datasets to a common scale (8x8 km), and taxonomically by aggregating taxa to the level of genera. Nonetheless, differences persist.  For example,  the FIA contains fewer plots per 8 km cell, with more trees per plot than the PLSS data. This leads to higher cell-to-cell variability in the FIA data, but these are not expected to affect the regional-scale analyses here, particularly because we are investigating presence/absence patterns. Additionally, FIA observations are collected only from forested or partially forested landscapes [@woudenberg2010forest], causing the spatial extent of many tree taxa to be lower in the FIA than in the PLSS datasets (`r tab_nums("genera_table", display="cite")`). Hence, scattered trees may be present in regions without permanent or temporary FIA plots, complicating the ability to assign 'absence' within the FIA. However the practice of using FIA data as a surrogate for tree presence/absence data is widespread [@iverson2013tree;@iverson1998predicting], so this complication is a general one faced by forest ecologists and global change ecologists.  In prior comparative analyses of the PLSS and FIA data, Goring et al. [-@goring2015preset] tested the effect of differential sampling design on the mapped patterns of novel and disappearing forests, and found little effect.

## Historical and Modern Climate Data

Historical and modern climate data are derived from monthly PRISM data for 1895 to 2014 CE [@prism]. The PRISM climate variables are available at an 800m resolution and have been interpolatedfrom climate stationlocations using elevation, aspectand other data.  Estimates for July temperature ($T_{jul}$), January temperature ($T_{jan}$), the annual temperature range ($T_{diff}$), and annual precipitation ($P_{ann}$) were obtained from PRISM and resampled to the 8 x 8km grid used for PLSS and FIA data using bilinear interpolation. Two periods were selected for the calculation of climate normals: 1895 to 1919 for the historical period and 1990 - 2014 for the modern period.  There is an unavoidable temporal mismatch between the historical climate data and the PLSS survey period, on the order of 50 to 70 years.  Few meteorological records exist in this region prior to 1895 CE, and no gridded dataset exists at high spatio-temporal resolution for this time period.  To check whether an 1895 to 1919 CE climate normal is a reasonable surrogate for pre-settlement climates we check the instrumental record against tree-ring-based paleoclimate reconstructions from the Palmer Drought Severity Index [@heim2002review] (`r fig_nums("land_use_clim", display = "cite")`).

## Shifts in Species Distributions in Climate Space

![modelgrid](figures/figureFour_panels.tiff)

`r fig_nums("fourPanel", "(a) Diagram of the 2x2 factorial design used to diagnose the effects of historic climate and vegetation change on the observed shifts in tree-climate relationships. We analyzed observed and hypothetical tree-climate relationships for one of four combinations of pre-settlement vegetation (pink fill, left column) or modern vegetation (blue fill, right column) and pre-settlement climate (solid border, top row) or modern climate (dashed border, lower row). (b-e) Representative normalized probability densities for Larix for each of the four combinations of climate and vegetation states, plotted relative to Tmax (b), Tdif (c), Tmin (d), and Pann (e).")`

Distributions of tree genera presences along climate gradients are described as probability density functions for both the pre-settlement and modern eras.  Differences in distributions are quantified using Hellinger distances [@matthes2015benchmarking] to compare the probability density functions among the four combined states of vegetation and climate ($V_{H}C_{H}$, $V_{H}C_{M}$, $V_{M}C_{H}$, $V_{M}C_{M}$, where V represents vegetation, C represents climate and the subscripts M and H represent modern and historical conditions, respectively). The total shift ($d_{tot}$) between presettlement conditions and modern conditions is calculated as the Hellinger distance between $V_{M}C_{M}$ and $V_{H}C_{H}$ densities (`r fig_nums("fourPanel", display = "cite")`a: top left to bottom right). The effect of historical climate change on shifting climate distributios of tree genera is determined by calculating the Hellinger distance ($d_{C}$) is determined by calculating the Hellinger distance between PLSS and FIA tree distributions when both are overlaid on late 19th-century climates ($V_{H}C_{H}$ versus $V_{M}C_{H}$; `r fig_nums("fourPanel", display = "cite")`a; left column). We develop an attribution index, ($\delta_{d}=d_{c} - d_{l}$), such that negative values of$\delta_{d}$ indicate stronger influence of historical land use on shifting climate distributions, while positive values indicate a stronger influence of historical climate change on shifting distributions.

To assess whether the effects of historical land use and climatic changes on a genera's climatic distribution is compounding, counteracting or confounding we perform a set of t-tests, using the conservative Bonferroni correction to account for multiple tests.  For each taxon and climate variable pair we test whether $V_{H}C_{H}$ and $V_{H}C_{M}$ (climate change), and $V_{H}C_{H}$ and $V_{M}C_{H}$ (land-use change) distributions are significantly different.   If both changes are significant and of the same sign, then the shift is defined as a compounding change.  If both are significant and are in opposite directions then the change is defined as counteracting.  In the case that either or both changes are not significant then the change is defined as confounding.

# Results

*The Results section should present the experiments that support the conclusions to be drawn later in the Discussion. The Results section should conform to a high standard of rigour. Extended lines of inference, arguments or speculations should not be placed in the Results.*

Regionally, January (minimum) temperatures have increased by `r round(clim_change[4], 1)`^o^C since the 1895-1925 normal `r fig_nums("land_use_clim", display = "cite")`, maximum annual temperature has declined (`r round(clim_change[2], 1)`^o^C), while mean annual temperatures increased by `r round(clim_change[3], 1)`^o^C (not shown). Because of the large shift in minimum temperatures, Tdiff has changed by .  Annual precipitation in the region has increased slightly (`r round(clim_change[1], 1)`mm).  The Palmer Drought Severity Index is closely coherent with Pann trends from 1895 onward and indicate no major climatic trends between 1800 and 1900 (`r fig_nums("land_use_clim", display = "cite")`e), suggesting that early 20^th^ century climates are a reasonable proxy for mid 19^th^ century climates.

```

For most tree genera, historic range losses dominate over range gains and are spatially structured (Figure 3). Range losses in the Upper Midwest are concentrated in the south and west, along the prairie-savanna-forest ecotone (Figure 3). For Ulmus and Larix, however, losses occur throughout the range.  Losses are highest for Ostrya/Carpinus and Larix when assessed as a proportion of total range (Table 2), and range losses are high generally, with an average of `r round(mean(loss_table$Loss), 1)`% across all taxa, *Larix*, *Ulmus* and *Betula* have the largest absolute losses in range within the Upper Midwest.  Gains, conversely, account for no more than `r round(max(loss_table$Gain),1)`% of any taxon's historical range, with the highest gains observed for Populus (Table 2) and averages `r round(mean(loss_table$Gain),1)`% across all taxa.   Spatial patterns of range gains vary widely among tree genera, and often show less spatial bias than losses (Figure 3).  Range gains for *Picea*, *Larix*, *Abies*, *Tsuga*, *Fagus*, *Ostrya*/*Carpinus*, *Tilia*, and *Fraxinus*, for example, all show a dispersed pattern of gains in a relatively few and widely scattered cells, suggesting that these apparent range gains are mainly caused by sampling uncertainty inherent in local-scale plots and stand heterogeneity, rather than systematic range gains.  Conversely, gains for *Populus* and *Acer*, are concentrated in northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, suggesting range infilling, while *Quercus* gains are consistent with some range extension northwards.  *Pinus*, *Thuja*, and *Ulmus* gains are limited but primarily in the southern portion of their historic range, or beyond it.

These shifts in realized climate distributions are produced by the joint effects of historical climate change, pathogen-induced tree mortality, and land-use change.")`

The joint effects of historic climate change and land use on tree-climate distributions are illustrated for *Larix* in Figure 2.  For *Larix* we see clear shifts in climate space (from solid to dashed lines) whether modern or presettlement vegetation distributions are used, indicating that historical climate change plays a strong role in shifting the distribution of *Larix* in climate space across all climate variables.  Historical land use also plays a role in shifting distributions, particularly for annual maximum temperature where losses at the highest Tmax values are visible from pre-settlement to modern, however, land use appears toplay a smaller role for the other climate variables.

Shifts in tree-climate distributions are significant for all genera and all climate variables (`r fig_nums("boxplot", display = "cite")`), even accounting for multiple comparisons (all p < 0.0001).  The directionality of shifts between historical and modern climate distributions are consistent across genera: modern maximum annual temperatures are lower for all genera, while minimum temperatures are higher (`r fig_nums("boxplot", display = "cite")`).  Across all genera modern annual precipitation is also higher than in the past.  *Larix* and *Ulmus* show the most extreme changes in climate space overall.  *Ulmus* shows the largest increase in minimum temperature ($\delta_{tmin}$ = 4.2 ^o^C) and the smallest increase occurs for *Larix*. Maximum annual temperature declines most for *Ostrya/Carpinus* ($\delta_{tmax}$ = -1.3 ^o^C) and declines least for *Ulmus* ($\delta_{tmax}$ = -0.4 ^o^C).  *Ulmus* shows the largest increase in mean precipitation ($\delta_{ppt}$ = 86mm), the smallest change is for *Larix* ($\delta_{ppt}$ = 42mm).

`r fig_nums("hellPlot", "The total shift in climatic distribution over the last 100 to 150 years for each tree genus ($d_{tot}$) plotted against the amount of shift caused by historic climate change vs. changes in tree distributions ($d_{C} - d_{V}$), the latter mainly due to historic land-use and pathogen outbreaks.  Results are plotted separately for each of the four climate variables considered here. Shifts in distributions are calculated as the Hellinger distance between tree-climate distributions for different combinations of pre-settlement and modern vegetation and climate (Fig. 2).

Both the total change in realized climate distributions and the attribution of these changes to historic land use or climate change varies strongly among taxa and among climate variables (Figure 5). Shifts in realized climate distributions over the last 100 to 150 years are largest for Ulmus (TJan, TJul), Larix (Tmax), Tsuga (Tmax and Pann), and Fagus (Pann).   Attribution analyses based on the d index (Figure 5) reveal that while many genera show the imprint of historic land use on shifting climatic niches, this shift is not uniform across taxa. Maximum temperature shows the greatest land use signal (Figure 5X), with effects particularly strong for Larix, Ulmus, and Fagus. The large shift in the distribution of Tsuga relative to July temperatures, conversely, appears to be mainly attributable to historic climate change. For minimum temperature (Figure 5X), shifting distributions of Ulmus and Cedar can be mainly attributed to land use change, while Larix and Betula have large shifts that are equally attributable to historic climate change and land use, and the niche shifts for other taxa are driven by changing climate.  The climatic signal is strongest for annual precipitation, with regional changes in annual precipitation being largely responsible for shifting climate niches (Figure 5X), while only Populus and Picea have seen climate niche shifts due to land-use that are larger than the climate shifts.

The majority of climate - land-use interactions are compounding (n = 30) or confounding (n = 28), while few (n = 2) show evidence of counteracting effects (`r tab_nums("compTable", display = "cite")`).  Compounding interactions are particularly strong for Tjul (Table 3), and are consistent with the observed trend of lowered Tmin (Figure 1) andlosses concentrated in the souther portions of species ranges (Figure 2); both tend to shift tree-climate distributions to cooler portions of climate space. These analyses are insenstitive to the type of correction applied to the *p*-value, although running the analysis without a correction factor reduces the counts of confounding relationships and increases counts in both counteracting and compounding interactions.  Patterns of interaction, by species, for $P_{ann}$ and $T_{diff}$ are significantly correlated (${\Chi^{2}}_4$ = 15.22), but are not significantly correlated for other climate variables.

For climate variables, the proportion of compounding interactions is greatest for $T_{max}$, and least for $T_{min}$, for which confounding interactions dominate.  For $P_{ann}$ and $T_{diff}$ we see a general balance of compounding and confounding interactions.  Only *Ulmus* (for $T_{max}$) and *Larix* (for $T_{min}$) show counteracting changes for climate/land-use interactions (`r tab_nums("compTable", display = "cite")`).

Several genera show common patterns in their relationships to climate/land-use interactions.  Poplar, spruce, oak, maple and birch all show compounding relationships for both $P_{ann}$ and $T_{max}$ and either compounding or confounding interactions for $T_{diff}$.  All five taxa show confounding interactions for $T_{min}$ (`r tab_nums("compTable", display = "cite")`).  These taxa all show significant losses in range along the southern and western margins of their distribution (`r fig_nums("gain_loss", display="cite")`), with little new distribution in those regions.

Fraxinus, Tsuga and Tilia all show confounding interactions with $P_{ann}$, $T_{diff}$ and $T_{min}$, with compounding interactions with $T_{max}$.  Each of these taxa show losses throughout historical distribution, but without clear spatial structure (`r fig_nums("gain_loss", display="cite")`). No taxa show patterns that are identical to another genera.

# Discussion

*The Discussion section should be separate from the Results section. It allows authors to propose their interpretation of the results, and to suggest what they might mean in a wider context. It should end with a clear statement of the main conclusions of the research, and a clear explanation of their importance and relevance.*

This work demonstrates that historic land use can substantially alter the realized climate niches of species and adds to our understanding of the interacting effects of climate change and land-use [@pyke2004habitat]. Land use change reduces the correlational structure between species and climate [@devineau2011arid] and is likely to have one of the strongest effects on changes in global biodiversity over the next century [@sala2000global]. While rates of land-use change may be declining in North America and in the upper Midwest [@dale1997landuse; @rhemtulla2009legacies] the legacies of land-use are likely to persist, both in terms of forest composition [@goring2015preset], and the correlational structure between species and climate. Paleoclimatic modeling indicates shifts in realized niches for species over time, potentially resulting from non-analogue climates or shifts in competition resulting from changing patterns of co-occurence through time [@maiorano2013building].

Shifts in realized climate space since Settlement may have important implications for the management of forest communities, and the fact that historical realized niches are broader than modern niches might lead us to be more optimistic than otherwise, however, projected climate change far exceeds the shifts due to historical land use and climate change.  In addition, coupled migration and adaptation in response to future climate change is likely to be impeeded by the exitrpation of communities due to land use change.  Species migration and genetic adaptation are coupled across time-scales [@davis2001range].  The loss of forest communities along the forest-prairie boundary in the Upper Midwest is particularly important given that the direction of climate change regionally is towards warmer conditions, conditions that exists at the forest-prairie boundary.  The loss of genotypes adapted to warmer and drier conditions (the lagging edge of distributions for many taxa in the Upper Midwest) may mean more rapid losses at the lagging edges of the species range.  Long distance gene flow of adaptive traits to central and leading populations from the lagging edge [@hu2006seed] is lost when land use conversion to agricultural production results in the extirpation of locally adapted populations.  Thus net gene flow in populations along the remaining "lagging" edge will be from the central and leading populations, individuals maladapted to warmer conditions. This maladaptive gene flow could potentially amplify the effects of climate change on populations along the forest-prairie boundary leading to increasing risk of local extinction among natural populations [@kremer2012long].

From a modern perspective, the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data set is an important resource for researchers, providing detailed data at fine grain over the entire contiguous United States. However, the FIA is also an incomplete record of tree species distributions in the United States since it limits plot surveys to plots with > 10% tree cover [@woudenberg2010forest].  In much the same way, climatic data plays an important role in building correlative models, but we are limited to the modern era [@pellatt2012using;@iverson1998predicting], while evidence strongly suggests historical datasets add considerably to our understanding of the breadth of species' climatic niches [@ivory2015; @maiorano2013building;@early2014climatic].

The use of correlational species-distribution models may be heavily impacted by historical land-use change and the sampling design of modern survey data.  Dorman et al. [@dormann2012correlation] propose a gradient of models, from correlative to process-based models for predicting species distributions.  While process based models may provide more accurate predictions of species distributions given the loss of spatial coverage as a result of land-use conversion, spatially biased land-use conversion could result in the extirpation of well-adapted genotypes within a population.  The inability to acurately reflect phenotypic variability along gradients of adaptation could then lead to weaker process-based models.  In this case, we might assume that both correlative and process based models would be affected by spatially biased land-use conversion, particularly at "lagging" margins of a species distribution.

At a broad scale, the presence of individual and isolated trees in unforested agricultural landscapes may be significant for adaptation, but it may also be the case that these trees remain on the landscape through anthropogenic agency, for example, as a result of irrigation or landscaping care within urban or rural locations that might otherwise not support forest cover [@brazel2000tale]. Human agency in these marginal environments ultimately leads urban ecosystems in deserts to closely resemble those in the northeastern United States [@groffman2014ecological], but may also support the extension of forest ecosystems at historical range margins, or preserve historical range margins from land use conversion to agriculture as windrows, or isolated woodlots.  Detailled sampling of tree species, particularly in urban and agricultural environments beyond the current expected range limits of species may provide broader coverage of a species' fundamental climate niche, but care must be taken to account for the intensive management that may be required to maintain species beyond their realized niche.

This work reinforces the importance of historical datasets for examining the relationships between species and climate, and their importance in forecasting species distributions in the future.  We show that modern inventory data samples only a subset of historical distribution, both spatially and within multidimentsional climate space.  Critically, we show that the combination of regional land-use change and climate change leads to the under-prediction of species resilliance to climate change regionally.  Regionally, annual temperature is expected to increase in Wisconsin by 3.6^o^C in 2055 from a 1980s baseline [@wicci2011climate].  Every tree genera examined in this study had historical $T_{max}$ values between 0.4 and 1.3^o^C higher than modern estimates, and with $P_{ann}$ between 42 and 86mm lower than modern estimates.  Projected changes in $P_{ann}$ range from -17 - 110mm from a 1980 baseline to 2055 based on fourteen global climate models compiled as part of the CMIP3 intercomparison [@wicci2011climate]. Higher temperatures and lower precipitation means for taxa in the historic period indicate the potential for more robust responses to climate change than might be assessed using modern data only.

Increasing forest fragmentation as a result of land use conversion overlies long term climate patterns.  In regions where land use conversion is climatically biased, conversion can affect the realized niche of tree species, particularly when sampling of those species is biased by a survey design that is itself biased by land use converison.  In the Upper Midwestern United States maximum temperatures have declined over the last century, but increases in minimum annual temperature, and land use conversion along the warm and dry forest-prairie margin have resulted in shifts that compound the apparent climatic shifts (`r tab_nums("compTable", display = "cite")`), resulting in a realized niche for most species that is less robust to future shifts in climate, toward warmer conditions with, potentially higher evapotranspiration.

While historical datasets may add to our ability to understand species realized climate niches and their adaptive potential in the face of climate change they also serve to underscore the important interactions between climate change and land use change at a population level.  The homogenization of midwestern forests evidenced through forest composition data [@goring2015preset;@rhemtulla2009legacies;@schulte2007homogenization;@hanberry2012comparison] may well be reflected in genetic data, although this is less well understood, and may be lost to us due to the broad-scale disturbance resulting from EuroAmerican Settlement in the region.  Ultimately, land-use history is a critical component of modern ecology that is under-represented in the literature [although see: @hamburg1986disturbance;@compton2000long;@foster1998land].
