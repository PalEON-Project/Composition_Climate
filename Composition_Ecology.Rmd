Abstract
====
* Observational datasets of contemporary species-climate relationships are widely used understand environmental controls on species distriutions and project the responses of species to 21^st^-century climate change.
* Given recent climate change and continued land use conversion, are species-climate relationships today representative of those in past.
* We assess the stability of species-climate relationships using historic PLSS data and FIA data.
* We show that species-climate relationships have significantly shifted for many taxa.
* Contemporary trees have shifted to cooler maximum temperatures, warmer winter temperatures, reduced seasonal temperature range, and wetter conditions.
* Relative importance of land use and climate change varies by taxon and climate variable.  
* Shifts in warmer temperature mainly due to land use change, etc.
* Implications sentence or two at the end.

*Historic land use and forest change over the centuries since Euroamerican settlement have significantly changed the structure and composition of forests in the upper Midwestern United States.  The extent to which this change has affected the realized climate niche for key taxa is less well known.*

*Predictions for future species range shifts are largely predicated on correlative models that relate modern species distributions to climate parameters in the modern era.  Given the extent of regional forest change, and recent losses to key forest taxa including Hemlock, Elm and Chestnut, it is possible that certain taxa have shifted their climatic distributions over the last century.  The additional pressure of climatically biased land use conversion for agriculture along the western and southern margins of the upper Midwest means that the shift in climate space may be most pressing in a region of climate space that is critically important for understanding future species responses to climate change.*

*Using contemporary and historical species distributions and climate data we show that modern forest tree genera occupy realized niches with cooler maximum temperatures, higher minimum temperatures and higher rainfall than they have in the past.*

Introduction
==============
4)	Some researchers have focused on historical resurveys to assess climate-driven range shifts (Moritz, Waller, Tingley, etc.)
5)	Others have examined stability or plasticity of species-climate distributions during the last deglaciation (Pearman, Veloz, AT Petersen, etc.)


Global change ecologists and biogeographers use contemporary distributions of species, and, increasingly, long-term datasets to map distributions of species and species traits within environmental space.  Distributions of species within climate space can be used to assess species risk and resilience to climate change [@pellatt2012using;@iverson2013tree;@iverson1998predicting;@anderson2013nichemodels] and these models are then used to inform management and adaptation decisions in the future, although their role in developing planning scenarios is often unclear [@guisan2013predicting]. Understanding climate-related risk and response for ecological communities within landscapes is critically important for future adaptation planning, but we are often limited by a narrow window of observation that may obscure greater plasticity in species-climate responses [@maiorano2013building], and the constraints that result from historical contingency [@svenning2015influence]. Process-based species distribution models using physiological data as a primary basis [e.g., @leiblein2015modelling] may address issues of climate disequilibrium within models, focusing on representing the true niche space using experimental data at the individual and community level, however, parameterization of these models is critical, and has been shown to provide poor match at high levels [@matthes]. Increasing recognition that historical distributions show evidence of lags in species climate responses [@webb1986vegetation;@ordonez2013realized;svenning2015influence] and that habitat loss through human agency can impact apparent species distribtutions at both long [@ivory2015] and shorter time scales [@sarmento2013impacts] point to the need to understand species-climate distributions across time-scales, wherever the model lies along the gradient from correlational to process based [@dormann]and to quantify land use interactions with distribution modelling.

Focus on past distributions has taken multiple approaches, including historical resurveys [@li2014drivers;@tingley2012push] which provide evidence of sustained shifts in distribution and co-occurence [@goring2016presettlement]. Integration of paleoecological data can provide greater insight into shifting ecological patterns within communities [@jackson2015community], but one of the largest shifts in community composition within the upper Midwestern United States occured with EuroAmerican Settlement in the 1800s [@goringetal2016;@otherrefs] as a result of changing land use, and simultaneously, regional shifts in climate at the end of the Little Ice Age [@paquette2013climatic;others]. Both land use change and climate change are ongoing, and the challenge of disentangling the influence of each on modern species distributions is complex. The interaction of land use change and climatic change has been of interest to conservation managers and scientists [e.g., @pyke2004habitat] since managed natural areas often represent a biased selection from the available environmental space [@scott2001nature].  Studies into the interactions between land use and climate change have been largely focused on future impacts [@oliver2014interactions;@jetz2007projected], but widespread land use conversion has already occured and has had significant impacts on modern vegetation structure and composition at regional [@gehrig2007tree] and global scales [@].  A useful framework for assessing the interaction of climate and land use change considers three types of interaction: (1) compounding, (2) confounding and (3) counteracting [modified from @pyke2004habitat]. Using this framework it is possible to understand both the nature of the climate/land use interaction and the potential effect on apparent species resiliance and future response to regional climate change.

Compounding effects, when climatic change and land use change are biased in the same direction, are seen in butterfly species in the northern Sierra Nevada mountains of California, where warming, compounded by land use conversion at the lowest elevations drives species upslope more rapidly than might otherwise be expected [@forister2010compounded].  Confounding effects may cause little overall change on species distributions, land use pressure falls within the central distribution for the environmental gradient. The spatial extent of Garry oak (*Quercus garryana*) in the Pacific Northwest has changed little, but land use conversion has excluded it from the deep soil sites it formerly occupied [@macdougall2004defining;@pellatt2014environmental], thus predictive models for Garry oak [@pellatt2012using] may show greater uncertainty than if complete historical distributions had been used. Contradicting effects result in a narrower climate niche for taxa. Some bird species in the Nierra Nevadas should show downslope migration in response to shifts in precipitation [@tingley2012push], but this downslope migration is limited by land use conversion in the lowlands.

Over the past 200 years centennial scale climate variability and land use change have interacted to transform the forests of the northeastern United States. There are clear indications that modern forests, as represented by the Forest and Inventory Analysis show greater homogeneity and significantly different species associations than forests surveyed as part of the Public Land Survey System, a survey that covered the western United States prior to widespread land use conversion in the late 1800s [@goring2015preset;@schulte2007homogenization].  Shifts in forest composition and co-occurrence has occured over a period during which climate has begun to show the effects of anthropogenic warming, and a period in which we have increasingly used the relationship between modern tree species distributions and climate to understand future responses of tree species and forest assemblages to climate change [@iverson2013tree;@iverson1998predicting].  One of the most significant changes to forest tree distributions in the upper midwest is the loss of extensive cover through land use change [@rhemtulla2009legacies], particularly along the historical prairie and savanna margins of the region (Figure 1f), where extensive land use conversion has left little natural land.

**Figure 1.** *(a-e) Climate change in the Upper Midwest over the last two centuries using PRISM data and North American Drought Atlas PDSI reconstructions.  Low temperatures in the 1970s result in lower T~max~ during the modern era, but climate change has resulted in higher T~min~ values than the early-century normals, along with increasing P~ann~.  PDSI shows strong coherence with P~ann~ in this region. (f) Patterns of land use change in the upper Midwestern United States. Land use data from the NLCD [@jin2013comprehensive].*

In the midwestern United States we see a strong gradient of temperature and precipitation that results in two major ecotones, one from prairie/savanna to closed forest, in an approixmately west to east direction, and one from conifer dominated, sub-boreal forests to decidious forest in a north to south direction.  Goring et al. [-@goring2015preset] have shown that land use change has significantly changed the strength and structure of this ecotone, and work across this regions has consistently shown a significant imprint of human land use change on this region [@rhemtulla2009legacies;@schulte2001original;@schulte2007homogenization;@radeloff2000historical]. Given that much of the land use change within the region occurs in the south, where agricultural conversion has largely eliminated open forests [@rhemtulla2009legacies] we might expect to see that species with more southerly distributions would show greater impacts of land use change on their distributions in climate space, assuming no shift in regional climate.  Conversely, species in the north should show little change if we expect that pre-settlement trees show similar regeneration patterns (with respect to simple presence/absence) following widespread logging.

Interaction between environmental gradients, land use patterns and taxa are likely to vary by region and environmental variable of interest. Species in the north may experience a confounding land use effect with respect to temperature, northward shifts due to warming temperatures may not have significantly manifested themselves, and land use conversion is likely to be heterogenous with respect to temperature since there is little agriculture in northern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota.  Thus, with respect to temperature we expect to see no shift in distribution along temperature gradients.

With respect to precipitation, particularly toward the forest-prairie margin, where land use conversion continues [@wright2013recent] we would expect to see compounding effects of land use and climate change. Northern species should be shifting away from drier habitat while land use in the northern prairie-forest margin intensifies, shifting species further than expected along the precipitation gradient. For southern tree species, land use conversion is primarily, and has primarily, occured along the southern margins of the region, parallel to temperature and precipitation gradients. This should result in compounding land use effects for all taxa with distributions in the region, resulting in narrower species distributions due to the loss of suitability and land use conversion along the southern margin of the species' range.

Critically, given the importance of modern distributional datasets for predicting species range shifts, contradicting and confounding land use effects may result in the impression of narrower climatic tolerances, or greater predictive uncertainty. Tree species are responding to climate change within forested landscapes, but the response is inconsistent. Differences in the distributions of mature trees and seedlings show responses in western North America [@monleon2015evidence], but appear to indicate range contraction, rather than northward expansion in eastern temperate North America [@zhu2012failure]. Modern correlational analysis leaves out historical distributions that can further improve our ability to predict future distributions and management implications of species shifts, potentially clouding our interpretation of these patterns. For species that reach their northern or western range limits in the upper Midwestern United States (*e.g.*, hemlock, beech, &tc.) this may be critical, since a narrowing of the apparent environmental envelope, due to the twin action of land use change and changing climate, may result in underprediction of species resiliance to climate change.

We use gridded climate data products (PRISM) and estimates of pre-settlement and modern forest vegetation [@goring2015preset] to develop climate-vegetation relationships for 15 major tree taxa in the upper Midwestern United States. By examining the interactions between climate, species distributions and land use change since EuroAmerican settlement we examine the possible implications of range shifts for future estimates of species resillience to climate change across the region.

Methods
===============
Pre-settlement era vegetation data from the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), aggregated to a 64 $km^{2}$ grid [@goring2016preset] is paired with annually resolved climate data for the region.  The PLSS era data is aggregated from survey data collected on a 1 x 1 mi grid across the Upper Midwest during the PLSS, from 1830 - 1904, in a time transgressive manner, from the south east to the north west.  At each survey point surveyors noted the closest two to four trees, recorded their distances to the plot center point, diameters and the azimuth to the tree.  Goring et al. [-@goring2015preset] aggregated this data to an 8 x 8 km grid to reduce local-scale variability, resulting in a gridded data product with an average of 61 plots per cell, or approximately 120 trees per cell.  When examining relationships between FIA and PLSS data, Goring et al. [-@goring2015preset] report significant relationships within the FIA relating dissimilarity from PLSS era forests and the number of FIA plots within an 8x8km cell, however this relationship accounts for only 3% of the total change in dissimilarity, indicating statistical significance, but little ecological significance on this regional scale.

Another complication is the structure of the FIA dataset.  While the PLSS data was collected across the western US on a uniform grid the FIA data is only collected from forested or partially forested landscapes [@woudenberg2010forest].  As such trees may be present in regions without permanant or temporary FIA plots, but no record of them exists within the FIA. This complicates our ability to assign 'absence' within the FIA, however the practice of using FIA data as a surrogate for presence/absence data is widespread [@iverson2013tree;@iverson1998predicting], and, at a broad scale, the presence of individual and isolated trees in unforested agricultural landscapes may be significant for adaptation, but it may also be the case that these trees remain on the landscape through anthropogenic agency, for example, as a result of irrigation or landscaping care within urban or rural locations, agency that ultimately leads urban ecosystems in deserts to closely resemble those in the northeastern United States [@groffman2014ecological].

The analysis presented here follows a blocked sampling method. We generate probability density functions along historical climate gradients for taxa within the PLSS and for the same PLSS taxa (and point locations) using climate data for the modern era. We do the same for FIA presence (climate at the PLSS and modern eras), and for anthropogenic land use classes. Climate data is derived from monthly PRISM data from 1895 - 2014. A 30-year climate normal was generated for modern July temperature ($T_{jul}$), January temperature ($T_{jan}$), the continentality (difference between $T_{jul}$ and $T_{jan}$, $T_{diff}$), and annual precipitation ($P_{ann}$).

The choice of a thirty year normal for the PLSS data is potentially problematic.  The time transgressive nature of the PLSS Survey means that some of the PLSS data was sampled in the early 1800s, while other come from the early 1900s [@goring2015preset;@white1983history], and for much of this time period no climatological records exist. Regardless, throughout this period climate variability exists (Figure 1d), and trees that were on the landscape from the 1830s to the 1880s are not expected to have been completely extirpated by annual scale climate variability in that same time period. As such the use of a 'pre-settlement' climate normal from 1895-1925 is likely a reasonable choice.  Regional-scale reconstructions from tree-rings and from pollen-based climate reconstructions tell us that there has been a trend of increasing temperatures (approximately 0.3^o^C in the Northern Hemisphere) since the 1800s, with pollen-based reconstructions showing even higher rates of change in the Midwestern United States [@viau2006millennial], with tree rings showing cooling at the 1800s to warming from the 1900s [@ahmed2013continental].  A second issue is that climate normals may be insufficient for modeling seedling recruitment [@serra2015averaged].  Given the widespread deforestation following settlement, one or few years of cold or hot weather could affect establishment regionally, resuling in a significantly changed landscape.

By generating kernel density estimates of taxon presence along climate gradients drawn from each of the four states of climate and vegetation ($PLSS_{veg}$-$PLSS_{clim}$, $PLSS_{veg}$-$FIA_{clim}$, $FIA_{veg}$-$PLSS_{clim}$, $FIA_{veg}$-$FIA_{clim}$) we can use Hellinger distance to estimate the effects of changing climate ($d_{H}$), or the effect of changing land use (d_H_ between kernel densities in the same row of Figure 2).  In particular, the effect of changing land use and climate (d_H_ between the top left and bottom right in Figure 2) can be parsed as the sum of differences in the left hand column (testing climate change) and the top row (testing land use only).  The relative magnitudes of these differences gives us an indication of the influence of either land use or climate in driving shifts in species distributions along the climate gradients in the Upper Midwest.

Results
---------------

Mean temperatures in the region show an average increase of `r round(clim_change[3], 2)`^o^C since the 1895-1925 normal.  Annual precipitation has increased slightly (`r round(clim_change[1], 0)`mm), and maximum annual temeprature has declined slightly (`r round(clim_change[2], 2)`^o^C).  The most significant change has been in annual minimum temperatures, which have increased by `r round(clim_change[4], 1)`^o^C since the 1895-1925 normal.  This broad scale increase in winter temperatures is widely accepted, and results in an overall shift in the winter 'climate space' for the region.

The Public Lands data is spatially extensive, sampling occured across the region in a regular pattern, while the FIA is limited to regions with forest cover.  As such, the extent of points is not overlapping. Given the extensive use of FIA data in generating and estimating climate responses of tree taxa and forest types to changing climate, the use of the FIA data as an estimate for tree species distributions is acceptable fo estimating shifts in climate space, and attributing the loss or gain of climate niche space due to land use and climate variability and change during the 20^th^ century.

In the box-and-whisker plots, the central line indicates the median, box margins indicate 25th and 75th percentiles, whisker tips indicate 5th and 95th percentiles, and dots indicate outliers beyong the 95th percentile. These shifts in realized climate distributions are produced by the joint effects of historical climate change, pathogen-induced tree mortality, and land use change.*

While these changes in climate are visible across the whole range, we would expect that species with significant shifts in distribution as a result of land use change in the post-settlement era should show changes that superceed the changes resulting from climate alone.  In particular, if the land use pressure is biased spatially or climatically then these changes should be even more dramatic.  Hellinger distance is used to understand the difference in the shape of kernel densities.  Using the distributions in climate space for each of the key taxa we can shift climate, or vegetation to understand the relative effects of land use change and climatic change across the region.

We analyzed observed and hypothetical tree-climate relationships for one of four combinations of pre-settlement vegetation (pink fill, left column) or modern vegetation (blue fill, right column) and pre-settlement climate (solid border, top row) or modern climate (dashed border, lower row).*

Hellinger distances reveal that while taxa may show the imprint of land use change on shifting climatic niches, this shift is not uniform across taxa not climatic  variables. Maximum temperature shows the greatest change attributed to land use change.  Tamarack, elm, poplar, spruce beech, cedar, and fir all show a greater influence for land use change than regional climate change. The precipitation panel (Figure 5) indicates that precipitation across the region has driven change in the species climate niche for this variable.  Only spruce and poplar show a marginally greater effect of land use change than climate change, wheras taxa such as beech and hemlock show a strong climate signal.

  **Figure 5**. *The total shift in climatic distribution over the last 100-150 years for each tree genus plotted against the amount of shift caused by historic climate change vs. changes in tree distributions, the latter mainly due to historic land use and pathogen outbreaks.  Results are plotted separately for each of the four climate variables considered here. Total shifts in distributions ($D_{tot}$) are calculated using the Hellinger distance between climatic distributions for tree genera for the presettlement and modern time periods.  The importance of historic climate shifts on shifting climate distributions of tree genera is determined by calculating the Hellinger distance between PLSS tree distributions overlaid with late 19th century climates versus modern climates ($D_{C}$).  The importance of historic vegetation change on shifting climate distributions of tree genera is determined by calculating the Hellinger distance between PLSS and FIA tree distributions when both are overlaid on late 19th-century climates ($D_{V}$).  $D_{C}$ and $D_{V}$ are then differenced from each other, such that negative values indicate a stronger influence of historic land use on shifting climate distributions, while positive values indicate a stronger influence of historic climate change on shifting distributions.*

Since the pre-settlement era maximum temperatures have declined, while minimum temperatures have increased strongly.

```

Our results show that the largest class of land use/climate interaction (Table 2) since the onset of EuroAmerican settlement in the Upper Midwest is Compounding, accounting for `r table(unlist(conf_table[,2:5]))["+"]/(nrow(conf_table)*4) * 100`% of the possible interactions.  Confounding interactions account for `r table(unlist(conf_table[,2:5]))["."]/(nrow(conf_table)*4)*100`% of interactions, while only `r table(unlist(conf_table[,2:5]))["-"]/(nrow(conf_table)*4)*100`% of interactions are contradicting.

There is no clear relationship between taxa with confounding, contradicting or compounding interactions and the spatial distribution of those taxa.  For climate variables, the proportion of compounding interactions is greatest for $T_{max}$, and least for $T_{min}$.  For other climate variables we see a general balance of Only Elm (for $T_{max}$) and Tamarack (for $T_{min}$) show contradicting changes for climate/land use interactions.


Discussion
----------------
This work adds to our understanding of the relationships between shifts in realized climate niches and the interacting effects of climate change and land use.  

Land use is likely to have one of the strongest effects on changes in global biodiversity over the next century [@sala2000global]. Land use change reduces the correlational structure between species and climate [@devineau2011arid]. While rates of land use change may be declining in North America and in the upper Midwest [@dale1997landuse; @rhemtulla2009legacies] the legacies of land use are likely to persist, both in reorganizing forested landscapes [@goring2015preset], and in the correlational structure between species and climate. Paleoclimatic modeling indicates shifts in realized niches for species over time, potentially resulting from non-analogue climates or shifts in competition resulting from changing patterns of co-occurence through time [@maiorano2013building].

From a modern perspective, the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data set is an important resource for researchers, providing detailed data at fine grain over the entire contiguous United States. However, the FIA is also an incomplete record of tree species distributions in the United States since it limits plot surveys to plots with > 10% tree cover [@woudenberg2010forest].  In much the same way, climatic data plays an important role in building correlative models, but we are limited to the modern era [@pellatt2012using;@iverson1998predicting], while evidence strongly suggests historical datasets add considerably to our understanding of the breadth of species' climatic niches [@ivory2015; @maiorano2013building;@early2014climatic].
