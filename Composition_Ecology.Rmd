Land use patterns and historical contingency change climate optima for key forest genera in the Northeastern United States.
========================================================

*Historic land use and forest change over the centuries since Euroamerican settlement have significantly changed 

```{r, fig.width=5}
# Load climate data and generate the pre-sett and modern bounds:
#  Pre-settlement climate: 1900 - 1930
#  Modern climate: 1960 - 1990

source('R/Setup_R.R')
source('R/load_climate.R') # gives then.clim & now.clim
source('R/load_fia.R')     # gives agg.dens
source('R/load_ncdf.R')    # gives western and eastern

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
